## Simple Compiler
This is a simple compiler written for the University of Helsinki [Compilers course](https://hy-compilers.github.io/spring-2025/project/). Compiler is written using Java 23.

### Sample
A simple program written in this language would be as follows.
```
var n: Int = read_int();
print_int(n);
while n > 1 do {
    if n % 2 == 0 then {
        n = n / 2;
    } else {
        n = 3*n + 1;
    }
    print_int(n);
}
```

### Build Source
**Note:** The generated assembly code is related to the x86-64 family of processors.
#### Prerequisites
* Java 23
* as - GNU assembler
* cc - C compiler
* ld - A linker in Unix OSes

Navigate to the directory and run `./gradlew clean build` which will generate the compiler as a jar in `build/libs/`.
You can use the compiler as a one time compilation tool or as a language server at the moment.
1. `java -jar uh-compiler-0.0.1.jar compile --output=path/to/output.out path/to/input.in`
2. `java -jar uh-compiler-0.0.1.jar serve --host=localhost --port=3000` - The server will respond to TCP requests `{"command": "ping"}` or `{"command":"compile", "code":"print_int(2);"}` with response as empty or `{"program":"base64-encoded statically linked x86_64 program"}`.

At the moment, the compiler can be run on Docker as a language server as well. Run `docker build -t . yourname/image_name:version` to build the image and run `docker run -p 3000:3000 yourname/image_name:version` to start the container. Container will respond to TCP requests as stated above.

### Language Spec
**Note:** Copied from the course page.

An expression is defined recursively as follows, where `E`, `E1`, `E2`, `â€¦` `En` represent some other arbitrary expression.

* Integer literal: a positive whole number.
* Negative numbers should be composed of token `-` followed by an integer literal token.
* Boolean literal: either `true` or `false`.
* Identifier: a word consisting of letters, underscores or digits, but the first character must not be a digit.
* Unary operator: either `-E` or `not E`.
* Binary operator: `E1 op E2` where `op` is one of the following: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `and`, `or`, `=`.
  * Operator `=` is right-associative.
  * All other operators are left-associative.
  * Precedences are defined below.
* Parentheses: `(E)`, used to override precedence.
* Block: `{ E1; E2; ...; En }` or `{ E1; E2; ...; En; }` (may be empty, last semicolon optional).
  * Semicolons after subexpressions that end in `}` are optional.
* Untyped variable declaration: `var ID = E` where `ID` is an identifier.
* Typed variable declaration: `var ID: T = E` where `ID` is an identifier and `T` is `Int`, `Bool` or `Unit`.
* If-then conditional: `if E1 then E2`
* If-then-else conditional: `if E1 then E2 else E3`
* While-loop: `while E1 do E2`
* Function call: `ID(E1, E2, ..., En)` where ID is an identifier

Variable declarations (`var ...`) are allowed only directly inside blocks `({ ... }`) and in top-level expressions.

#### Precedences

1. `=`
2. `or`
3. `and`,
4. `==`, `!=`
5. `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`
6. `+`, `-`
7. `*`, `/`, `%`
8. Unary `-` and `not`
9. All other constructs: literals, identifiers, if, while, var, blocks, parentheses, function calls.

The program consists of a single top-level expression. If the program text has multiple expressions separated by semicolons, they are treated like the contents of a block, and that block becomes the top-level expression. The last expression may be optionally followed by a semicolon.

Arbitrary amounts of whitespace are allowed between tokens. One-line comments starting with `#` or `//` are supported.
